# prairieKing
This is my final project for the Web Systems Programming course (CSE264) at Lehigh University. It is a recreation of the first five levels of Journey of the Prairie King from ConcernedApe's game Stardew Valley, written in JavaScript using HTML canvas graphics. The player must avoid enemies for a certain amount of time to progress to the next level, and a final boss - the outlaw - must be defeated to win. I'm proud to say that I received an 100% on this project, and the TA who graded it commented that it was "Literally Amazing."

The enemies and projectiles are JavaScript classes. Event handlers track when keys are pressed, a draw function draws each image to the canvas, and an update function controls how the player and enemies move. I used promises to ensure that images display only when all of them are loaded.
